# tree-sitter-jai
Tree-sitter grammar for the language. I needed it because I rely on tree-sitter for
auto indents. It is incomplete, but I intend to make it better as I'm learning the
language.

# TODO
- [x] run statements
- [-] organize code and label things
- [ ] if expressions are somewhat limited due to them increasing the complexity (and slowness) of the parser
- [ ] fix conflicts which I lazily ignored before
- [ ] organize syntax boundries
- [ ] using statements
- [ ] parameterized imports
