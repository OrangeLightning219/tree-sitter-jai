# tree-sitter-jai
Tree-sitter grammar for the language. I needed it because I rely on tree-sitter for
auto indents. It is incomplete in terms of language features and it probably will produce
some misses because I didn't spend enough time fine-tuning and testing it, but it's
fine for what I need it to do. It is also not fully tested.

# TODO
- [ ] using statements
- [ ] if expressions are somewhat limited due to them increasing the complexity (and slowness) of the parser
